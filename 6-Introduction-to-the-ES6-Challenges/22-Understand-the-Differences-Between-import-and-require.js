// I learned that the import function is used to import a particular function from a module or file. This is useful because previously you had to use the require function which imported all functions from that source. Also, its useful to add spaces to the start and end of the imported function's name to make it easier to read. 

"use strict";
import { capitalizeString } from "string_functions"
capitalizeString("hello!");
