// I learned that variables can be added to a string with the plus equals operator. This is called appending a variable to a string.

// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective ="fun";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
