// I learned how to use a conditional or ternary operator, which functions similar to an if else statement. A condition is expressed and the function returns the first statement if it is true, and the second statement if it is false.

function checkEqual(a, b) {
  return a === b ? true : false;
}

checkEqual(1, 2);
