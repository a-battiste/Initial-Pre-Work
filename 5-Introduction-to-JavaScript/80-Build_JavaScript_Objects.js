// I learned that objects are used to store data in a structured way, and their data is modified through their properties. Object properties are always typecast as strings.

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "Rex",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["Loki", "Bud"],




};
