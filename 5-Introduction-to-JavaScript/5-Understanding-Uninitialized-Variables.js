// I learned that variables that aren't assigned a value have an intial value of undefined. Mathematical operations on an undefined variable will yield the result: NaN (not a number), while concatenated strings with undefined variables yield the response: "undefined"

// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
