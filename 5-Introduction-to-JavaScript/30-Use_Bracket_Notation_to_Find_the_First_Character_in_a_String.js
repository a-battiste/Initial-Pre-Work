/* I learned how to find a character of a string at a specific index by using bracket notation. The index refers to the character's numbered location in the string, starting with 0 for the first character. */

// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
