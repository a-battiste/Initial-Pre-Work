// I learned how to concatenate a string with a variable. The name of the variable in the string does not need quotes around it. 

// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName ="Aris Battiste";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
