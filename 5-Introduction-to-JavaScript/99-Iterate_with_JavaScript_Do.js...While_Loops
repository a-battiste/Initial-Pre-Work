 // I learned that a do while loop is almost the same as a while loop, except the code in loop will run for the first loop, even if the variable value doesn't pass the condition condition/while statement.

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

// Only change code below this line.

 do {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
 } while (i < 5);
