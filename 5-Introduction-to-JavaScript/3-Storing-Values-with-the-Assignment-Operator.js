/* I learned how to assign a value to a variable by using the assignment operator or "=" symbol. Assignnment always goes from right to left, and the value on the right has to be resolved before being assigned to a variable. */

// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;

// Only change code below this line
var a = 7;
var b = a;
