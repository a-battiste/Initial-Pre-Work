// I learned how to use an if statement to execute a code under specified conditions. When a statement falls under the if conditions, it is true and the statement executes. If the statement does not fall under the condition, it is false and will not execute. These conditions are called Boolean conditions.

// Example
function ourTrueOrFalse(isItTrue) {
  if (isItTrue) {
    return "Yes, it's true";
  }
  return "No, it's false";
}

// Setup
function trueOrFalse(wasThatTrue) {

  // Only change code below this line.
  if (wasThatTrue) {
      return "Yes, that was true";
  }
  return "No, that was false";

  // Only change code above this line.

}

// Change this value to test
trueOrFalse(true);
