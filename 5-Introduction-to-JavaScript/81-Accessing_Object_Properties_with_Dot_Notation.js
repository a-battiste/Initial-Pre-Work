// I learned how to access object properties with dot notation, which is used when you know the name of the property you want to access beforehand. 

// Setup
var testObj = {
  "hat": "ballcap",
  "shirt": "jersey",
  "shoes": "cleats"
};

// Only change code below this line

var hatValue = testObj.hat;      // Change this line
var shirtValue = testObj.shirt;    // Change this line
