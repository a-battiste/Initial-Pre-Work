// I learned that a local variable with the same name as a global variable has precedence over a global variable inside of a function.

// Setup
var outerWear = "T-Shirt";

function myOutfit() {
  // Only change code below this line
  var outerWear = "sweater";


  // Only change code above this line
  return outerWear;
