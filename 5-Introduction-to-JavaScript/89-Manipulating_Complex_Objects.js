// I learned how to create a complex data structure by using strings, numbers, arrays, and objects. Data structures can also have booleans and functions as well. I also learned that JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation is a format to store data, as shown below. 

var myMusic = [
  {
    "artist": "Billy Joel",
    "title": "Piano Man",
    "release_year": 1973,
    "formats": [
      "CD",
      "8T",
      "LP"
    ],
    "gold": true
  }
  ,
  {
    "artist": "Travis Scott",
    "title": "Astroworld",
    "release_year": 2018,
    "formats": [
      "CD",
      "Apple Music",
      "LP"
    ]
  }
];
