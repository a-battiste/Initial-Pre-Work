/* I learned how to find the nth character from the last character of string. It works just like finding the last character of a string, but replace 1 with the number character away from the last character. */

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var thirdToLastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 3];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
